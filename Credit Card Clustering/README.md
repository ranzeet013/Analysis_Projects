Credit Card Clustering Project:
                             This project aims to cluster credit card customers based on their spending habits and demographic information. The goal is to identify
                              groups of customers with similar characteristics and behavior, which can then be used for targeted marketing and personalized offerings.

Data:
     The dataset used in this project contains information on 2,000+ credit card customers, including their age, gender, income, credit limit, and various spending
     attributes such as average monthly balance, total purchase amount, and cash advance amount.

Methodology:
     The project follows the following steps:
       1.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values, duplicate records, and outliers. The dataset is then preprocessed to
                                           normalize and scale the numerical attributes.
       2.Feature Engineering: New features are created from the existing attributes, such as the ratio of purchase amount to credit limit, which can provide 
                              additional insights into customer behavior.     
       3.Clustering: Various clustering algorithms, such as K-Means, Hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN, are applied to group the customers based on their
                     attributes.
       4.Cluster Analysis: The clusters are analyzed based on their demographic and spending characteristics to identify the unique characteristics of each group.
       5.Interpretation and Visualization: The results are visualized using various charts and graphs to provide insights and actionable recommendations.
       
Deliverables:
          The deliverables of this project include:
                                          1.A Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis.
                                          2.A report summarizing the findings, including the clusters' characteristics and insights.
                                          3.Visualizations of the clusters and their attributes.
Conclusion:
           Clustering credit card customers can provide valuable insights into their behavior and preferences, which can be used to tailor marketing campaigns and 
           improve customer satisfaction. This project demonstrates how clustering techniques can be applied to customer segmentation and how it can help businesses 
           make data-driven decisions.
